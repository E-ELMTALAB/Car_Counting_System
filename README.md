# Car Counting System

Road authorities are faced with the challenging task of effectively monitoring and identifying numerous vehicles on roadways. Counting the precise number of cars entering and exiting a roadway can be particularly arduous. However, thanks to advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI), this challenge can now be overcome. A sophisticated system has been developed to accurately count all vehicles utilizing advanced object detection and tracking algorithms.

# Description

The yolov5 model plays a crucial role in the comprehensive vehicle detection and tracking system. It efficiently detects and tracks vehicles in both the entering and exiting directions of the road. The system strategically focuses on the specific areas designated as the real entering and exiting points of the road, ensuring precise and reliable detection. By excluding vehicles outside the road area, the system eliminates unnecessary tracking and optimizes the accuracy of the vehicle count. To further enhance tracking capabilities, a robust and advanced algorithm is implemented, guaranteeing the uninterrupted and error-free tracking of detected vehicles. This integrated approach ensures a thorough and accurate assessment of vehicle movement, contributing to effective traffic monitoring and management.The program employs a sophisticated algorithm that enables efficient car detection and tracking with a remarkably high refresh rate, utilizing only the CPU for processing. Through extensive testing, the estimated refresh rate ranges between 40 to 55 frames per second (fps). This remarkable performance ensures smooth and real-time tracking of vehicles, enhancing the system's overall effectiveness.
